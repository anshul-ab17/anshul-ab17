In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified Diamond by the RIAA and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.[1]

<p><span> Characterized by their punk aesthetic</span>, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, In Utero (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Formation and early years (1987-1988)</h3>
<p> Singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic met while attending Aberdeen High School in Washington state.[2] The pair became friends while frequenting the practice space of the Melvins.[3] Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond for a long period. Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. Their first band, the Sellouts, was a Creedence Clearwater Revival tribute band.[4] The project featured Novoselic on guitar and vocals, Cobain on drums, and Steve Newman on bass. After a short time, however, the project fell through.[5] Another project, this time featuring originals, was also attempted in late 1986. Bob McFadden was enlisted to play drums, but after a month the project fell through.[6] In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard.[7] They practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming

<h3>Early releases (1988-1990)</h3>
<p>
  Nirvana released its first single, a cover of Shocking Blue's "Love Buzz", in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop.[15] They did their first interview with John Robb in Sounds, which made their release its single of the week. The following month, the band began recording its debut album, Bleach, with local producer Jack Endino.[16] Bleach was influu're using a modern framework, it probably transforms your source code from a format that's easy for you to maintain into a format that's optimized to run as quickly as possible.

<h3>Mainstream breakthrough (1991-1992)</h3>
<p>
 Disenchanted with Sub Pop and with the Smart Studios sessions generating interest, Nirvana decided to look for a deal with a major record label since no indie label could buy the group out of its contract.[34] Cobain and Novoselic consulted Soundgarden and Alice in Chains manager Susan Silver for advice.[35][36] They met Silver in Los Angeles and she introduced them to agent Don Muller and music business attorney Alan Mintz, who was specialized in finding deals for new bands. Mintz started sending out Nirvana's demo tape to major labels looking for deals.[35][36] Following repeated recommendations by Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, Nirvana signed to DGC Records in 1990.[37] When Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, Novoselic thanked Silver during his speech for "introducing them to the music industry properly".[38]

After signing, the band began recording its first major label album, Nevermind. The group was offered a number of producers, but held out for Vig.[39] Rather than record at Vig's Madison studio as they had in 1990, production shifted to Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California. For two months, the band worked through a variety of songs. Some, such as "In Bloom" and "Breed", had been in Nirvana's repertoire for years, while others, including "On a Plain" and "Stay Away", lacked finished lyrics until midway through the recording process.[40] After the recording sessions were completed, Vig and the band set out to mix the album. However, the recording sessions had run behind schedule and the resulting mixes were deemed unsatisfactory. Slayer mixer Andy Wallace was brought in to create the final mix. After the album's release, members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind

<h3>In Utero, final months, and Cobain's death (1993–1994)</h3>
<p>
 In February 1993, Nirvana released "Puss" / "Oh, the Guilt", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch & Go.For their third album, Nirvana chose producer Steve Albini, who had a reputation as principled and opinionated in the American indie music scene. While some speculated that Nirvana chose Albini for his underground credentials, Cobain said they chose him for his "natural" recording style, without layers of studio trickery.Albini and Nirvana recorded the album in two weeks in Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, that February for $25,000.

After its completion, stories ran in the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek that quoted sources claiming DGC considered the album "unreleasable". Fans became concerned that Nirvana's creative vision might be compromised by their label.While the stories about DGC shelving the album were untrue, the band was unhappy with certain aspects of Albini's mixes; they thought the bass levels were too low, and Cobain felt that "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies" did not sound "perfect".Longtime R.E.M. producer Scott Litt was called in to remix the two songs, with Cobain adding more instrumentation and backing vocals.

In Utero topped the American and British album charts. Time critic Christopher John Farley wrote in his review, "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." In Utero went on to sell over 5 million copies in the United States.[47] That October, Nirvana embarked on its first tour of the United States in two years with support from Half Japanese and the Breeders.For the tour, the band added Pat Smear of the punk rock band Germs as second guitarist.

<h3>Disbandment and aftermath (1994–1997)</h3>
<p>
 Plans for a live album, Verse Chorus Verse, were canceled as Novoselic and Grohl found assembling the material so soon after Cobain's death emotionally overwhelming.[75] Instead, in November 1994, DGC released the MTV Unplugged performance as MTV Unplugged in New York; it debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, and earned Nirvana a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. It was followed by Nirvana's first full-length live video, Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!.[56][76] In 1996, the live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah became the third consecutive Nirvana release to debut at the top of the Billboard album chart.[56]

In 1994, Grohl founded a new band, Foo Fighters. He and Novoselic decided against Novoselic joining; Grohl said it would have felt "really natural" for them to work together again, but would have been uncomfortable for the other band members and placed more pressure on Grohl.[77] Novoselic turned his attention to political activism.[56]

<h3>Conflicts with Love (1997–2006)</h3>
<p>
  In 1997, Novoselic, Grohl, and Love formed the limited liability company Nirvana LLC to oversee Nirvana projects.[78] A 45-track box set of Nirvana rarities was scheduled for release in October 2001.[79] However, shortly before the release date, Love filed a suit to dissolve Nirvana LLC, and an injunction was issued preventing the release of any new Nirvana material until the case was resolved.[80] Love contended that Cobain was the band, that Grohl and Novoselic were sidemen, and that she had signed the partnership agreement originally under bad advice. Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain's estate.[79]

The day before the case was set to go to trial in October 2002, Love, Novoselic, and Grohl announced that they had reached a settlement. The next month, the best-of compilation Nirvana was released, featuring the previously unreleased track "You Know You're Right", the last song Nirvana recorded.[81] It debuted at number three on the Billboard album chart.[82] The box set, With the Lights Out, was released in November 2004. The release contained early Cobain demos, rough rehearsal recordings, and live tracks. An album of selected tracks from the box set, Sliver: The Best of the Box, was released in late 2005

<h3>Further reissues and reunions (2006–present)</h3>
<p>
Further releases have included the DVD releases of Live! Tonight! Sold Out!! in 2006,[85] and the full version of MTV Unplugged in New York in 2007.[86] In November 2009, Nirvana's performance at the 1992 Reading Festival was released on CD and DVD as Live at Reading,[87] alongside a deluxe 20th-anniversary edition of Bleach.[88] DGC released a number of 20th anniversary deluxe-edition packages of Nevermind in September 2011[89] and In Utero in September 2013.[90]

In 2012, Grohl, Novoselic, and Smear joined Paul McCartney at 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief.[91] The performance featured the premiere of a new song written by the four, "Cut Me Some Slack". A studio recording was released on the soundtrack to Sound City, a documentary film by Grohl.[92][93] On July 19, 2013, the group played with McCartney again during the encore of his Safeco Field "Out There" concert in Seattle, the first time Nirvana members had performed together in their hometown in over 15 years.

<h2>Musical style</h2>
<p>
Nirvana's musical style has been mainly described as grunge,[104][105][106][107] alternative rock,[108][109] punk rock,[110] and hard rock.[68] Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana fused pop melodies with noise.[68] Billboard described their work as a "genius blend of Kurt Cobain's raspy voice and gnashing guitars, Dave Grohl's relentless drumming and Krist Novoselic's uniting bass-work that connected with fans in a hail of alternately melodic and hard-charging songs".[111]

Cobain described Nirvana's initial sound as "a Gang of Four and Scratch Acid ripoff".[57] When Nirvana recorded Bleach, Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and suppressed his arty and pop songwriting in favor of a more rock sound.[112] Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad argued, "Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that helped the band find its musical identity." Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that they had grown up listening to Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, they had been able to move on from their derivative early sound.[113]

Nirvana used dynamic shifts that went from quiet to loud.[65] Cobain sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds, saying, "I wanted to be totally Led Zeppelin in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs." When Cobain heard the Pixies' 1988 album Surfer Rosa after recording Bleach, he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but had been too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.[114] Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals".[115] Near the end of his life, Cobain said the band had become bored of the "limited" formula, but expressed doubt that they were skilled enough to try other dynamics.[65]
</p>


<h3>Songwriting and lyrics</h3>
<p>
Everett True said in 1989, "Nirvana songs treat the banal and pedestrian with a unique slant".[124] Cobain came up with the basic components of each song, usually writing them on an acoustic guitar, as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl had a large part in deciding the lengths and parts of songs, and that he did not like to be considered the sole songwriter.[125]

Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs minutes before recording them.[125] Cobain said, "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all".[126] Cobain told Spin in 1993 that he "didn't give a flying fuck" what the lyrics on Bleach were about, figuring "Let's just scream some negative lyrics and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay", while the lyrics to Nevermind were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to In Utero were "more focused, they're almost built on themes".[127] Cobain did not write in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; he said, "I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are
</p>


<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Combined with their themes of abjection and alienation, Nirvana became hugely popular during their short tenure[129] and are credited with bringing alternative rock to the mainstream.[111][130] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that prior to Nirvana, "alternative music was consigned to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off". Following the release of Nevermind, "nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse".[131] While other alternative bands had achieved hits, Nirvana "broke down the doors forever", according to Erlewine; the breakthrough "didn't eliminate the underground", but rather "just gave it more exposure".[132] Erlewine also wrote that Nirvana "popularized so-called 'Generation X' and 'slacker' culture".[132] Following Cobain's death, numerous headlines referred to Nirvana's frontman as "the voice of a generation", although he had rejected such labeling during his lifetime.

<h2>Awards and accolades</h2>
<p>
Since their breakup, Nirvana has continued to receive acclaim. In 2003, they were selected as one of the inductees of the Mojo Hall of Fame 100.[144] The band also received a nomination in 2004 from the UK Music Hall of Fame for the title of "Greatest Artist of the 1990s".[145] Rolling Stone placed Nirvana at number 27 on their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time" in 2004,[146] and at number 30 on their updated list in 2011.[147] In 2003, the magazine's senior editor David Fricke picked Kurt Cobain as the 12th best guitarist of all time.[148] Rolling Stone later ranked Cobain as the 45th greatest singer in 2008[149] and 73rd greatest guitarist of all time in 2011.[150] VH1 ranked Nirvana as the 42nd greatest artists of rock and roll in 1998,[151] the 7th greatest hard rock artists in 2000,[152] and the 14th greatest artists of all time in 2010.[153]

Nirvana was announced in their first year of eligibility as being part of the 2014 class of inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on December 17, 2013. The induction ceremony was held April 10, 2014, in Brooklyn, New York, at the Barclays Center.[164] As the accolade was only applied to Cobain, Novoselic and Grohl, former drummer Chad Channing was not included in the induction, and was informed of his omission by SMS
